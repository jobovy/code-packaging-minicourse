    "# The basic structure of a Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I will explain the basic structure of a Python package, which provides a skeleton onto which you can add the features that we will discuss later in these notes (documentation, automated testing, etc.). One way to learn about package structure is to peruse Python packages on GitHub, e.g., ``galpy``'s [GitHub page](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy). But because these packages have many complex maintenance features implemented and they may use files specific to GitHub integration, this can be a confusing way to start learning the structure of Python packages (however, once you know the basics, looking at other packages is a great way to discover new features that you may want to use in your own package; in general, you can learn a lot by reading other people's code). \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, there exists a wide variety of package generators, pieces of code that will generate skeleton packages that you can fill in to create your own package. A popular class of such package templates are those generated using the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) command-line utility, which allows you to generate package skeletons for many different languages / layouts simply by calling ``cookiecutter`` with the URL of a template. For example, ``astropy`` provides a cookiecutter [package template](https://github.com/astropy/package-template) specific to packages in the ``astropy`` eco-system. In general, I shy away from using such templates, certainly for beginning packagers, because these templates come with a confusing amount of advanced features that obscure the basic structure of a package and that distract from the basic development of the package (when I generate a template using the ``astropy`` template, I don't even know where to start putting code!). Cookiecutter templates are useful for advanced users creating many packages, but for the purpose of learning about packaging, I think it is better to build the package from the ground up and add each advanced feature individually later."

    "## Naming your package\n",
    "\n",
    "The first decision you have to make when creating a package is what to name it. Because it is annoying to rename a package later, this is an important decision to make early on and it is worth spending at least a few moments thinking about a good name. A memorable, catchy name will help your package gain attention. Indeed, I am very happy to have snatched the \"galpy\" name when it was available and even then I only ended up with \"galpy\", because the name I had originally wanted to use was ``pygd`` (for \"Python galactic dynamics\"), but this name was already taken by [a project on sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygd/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being catchy, it is also important for a name to be unique, so you'll want to check that the name is not already in use by another project. For Python packages, it's essential to check that there is no package of the name you are thinking about available on the [Python Packaging Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI), by searching their database. This is essential, because eventually you'll want to be able to install your package using a simple ``pip install PACKAGE_NAME``, because that is the first thing that users will try when they learn that they need to use your package. If ``pip install PACKAGE_NAME`` installs a *different* package, many users will end up being very confused. So while you can have a different PyPI name from your package name, in the case of a conflict it is better to move away from your intended package name and choose one that is available. For a Python package, being available on PyPI is the most important consideration, but you might also want to check [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/) to check more generally against names of open-source projects (not necessarily in Python) and search GitHub (although in the case of GitHub, the most important conflicts would be with packages that actually appear to be used by a wider community). To make sure that the name does not disappear while you are developing, you may want to register your package on PyPI as soon as possible, by [publishing a first release](07-Package-Release.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for what to choose as a name, tastes differ. Many Python packages choose to end in ``py`` to make it clear that they are Python packages (e.g., ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``astropy``, ``galpy``), but this is not a rule and a package name can be anything (indeed, the number of good, available names ending in \"py\" is rapidly dwindling). You can choose a name that succinctly describes what your package does (this has long been my own preferred naming convention, leading to such dryly named packages as ``apogee``, ``mwdust``, ``gaia_tools``) or you can choose a clever name or acronym (my own forays in this direction are ``wendy`` and ``kimmy``, although nobody ever seems to get them...; also illustrating that you can just end in \"y\"!). But I would recommend keeping the name of your package relatively short, because even in the age of tab-completion, people using your code will end up typing its name *a lot*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will not have to tediously refer to ``PACKAGE_NAME`` as the name of our under-construction package, from now on we will use ``exampy`` as the example (get it?) package. I will use ``exampy`` throughout these notes to illustrate everything that is being discussed. The ``exampy`` package is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/jobovy/exampy) and [here on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/exampy/)."

    "Once you have decided on a name, it is time to start building your package. Make a directory that will hold your package, which I typically give the name of the package, but this is not required. Later, we will host this entire directory on GitHub and I will refer to it as the \"top-level directory\". In this top-level directory, your package will be contained in a sub-directory that has the name of your package, in our example case this is ``exampy/``. This directory will contain all of your code. Other sub-directories of the top-level directory will hold documentation and tests and sub-directories will also be automatically be generated when you build and distribute your code (more on that later). We will be using this example package throughout the rest of these notes to illustrate documentation and testing tools, so you may want to follow along and implement this simple package yourself to be able to keep using it in the next chapters. You might want to add it to GitHub as ``exampy-GITHUBUSERNAME`` to distinguish it from the [original package](https://github.com/jobovy/exampy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Files in the top-level directory largely hold meta-information about your package. The top-level directory should have a README file with basic information about the package, it will hold the [license file](#Code-licenses), eventually it will contain configuration files for automated documentation generation and for continuous integration of tests (but not yet!), if you host the package on GitHub it may have one or more files specific to GitHub integration, and it will hold a few files related to the installation and distribution of your code, the most important being the ``setup.py`` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are building the package from the ground up, at first our package will have the following structure\n",

    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "To make the package into an importable Python module, the package directory needs to contain an ``__init__.py`` file, which can simply be an empty file created using ``touch exampy/__init__.py``. So a full-fledged, bare-bones Python package looks like\n",
    "```\n",
    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without writing any further code under ``exampy/`` (but with a basic ``setup.py`` file that we will describe below), this example package could be installed and imported in a Python session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``__init__.py`` file contains everything that is imported by ``import exampy`` or ``from exampy import *`` (which you should never do!). You can put functions and classes directly in the ``__init__.py`` file or you can write them in other files (to organize your code more clearly) and import them in ``__init__.py`` to make them easily accessible. For example, say that we implement a first set of basic math functions in ``_math.py`` and our package now looks like\n",
    "```\n",
    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",
    "        __init__.py\n",
    "        _math.py\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "then without adding code to ``__init__.py`` we need to ``from exampy import _math`` to gain access to the functions in ``_math.py``; ``import exampy`` would, for example, not allow access to ``exampy._math``. If you want the functions to be available under ``import exampy`` directly, you can import them in the ``__init__.py`` as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# __init__.py\n",
    "from ._math import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "(although better would be to explicitly import all of the functions that you want to import). This will make functions in ``_math.py``, say you have a function ``def square(x): return x**2``, as ``exampy.square``, available through, e.g., ``from exampy import square``. Alternatively, if you want to retain the \"\\_math\" part of the function, you can do\n",
    "```\n",
    "# __init__.py\n",
    "from . import _math\n",
    "```\n",
    "which makes the ``square`` function available as ``exampy._math.square``. In both of these cases, we get the ``square`` function using a simple ``import exampy``. I discuss below why I chose to start the ``_math.py`` filename with an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your code grows in complexity, you likely will want to separate functionality into different submodules, such as ``exampy.integrate``, which will contain functions to integrate mathematical functions. As we saw above, such a structure can be generated by having a single file ``integrate.py`` under the main ``exampy/`` directory, but to allow for ``integrate`` to consist of multiple files, it is better to make a directory ``integrate`` under ``exampy`` and use an ``__init__.py`` file in that directory to make it a submodule. In this case, our example package's layout becomes\n",

    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",

    "        _math.py\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everything that we have discussed so far for the main ``exampy/`` directory contents holds for this submodule as well: we can either write code in ``integrate/__init__.py`` directory or in different files in that directory. For example, imagine that we have a file ``integrate/_integrate.py`` that implements a simple [Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) ``def riemann(func,a,b,n=10): return np.sum(func(np.linspace(a,b,n))*(b-a)/n)``. Then with an empty ``integrate/__init__.py`` file we have to ``import exampy.integrate._integrate`` to gain access to ``exampy.integrate._integrate.riemann`` (or ``from exampy.integrate import _integrate`` or similar), *or* we can again import the ``riemann`` function in ``integrate/__init__.py`` to make it accessible through a simple ``from exampy import integrate`` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convention I personally follow is to define submodules as much as possible through subdirectories rather than as files, pulling all of a (sub)module's functionality into its ``__init__.py`` file to make it accessible to the user. This is why I gave the non-``__init__.py`` files in the example above names that start with an underscore. This indicates in the Python universe that these are *internal* parts that should not be accessed directly by users; their functionality is exposed to users by importing it into the (sub)module's ``__init__.py`` file. But this is largely a matter of taste, the most important considerations being keeping things simple for the user and keeping the code easily understandable for yourself (in that order!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The considerations in naming submodules are similar to those discussed in naming the package as a while [above](#Naming-your-package): choose short, descriptive names (not clever ones in this case; great examples are ``scipy.integrate``, ``scipy.interpolate``, which immediately make clear what these submodules do and don't do)."

To use ``setuptools``, we write a ``setup.py`` file that includes all of the information necessary to build, install, and package the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some packages use a ``setup.cfg`` configuration file to define the necessary information, but even in that case one still needs to write a ``setup.py`` file that ingests the configuration file and hooks it up to ``setuptools``. While this has some advantages, for beginning users I think it is easier to directly write the ``setup.py`` file, which is instructive and also allows for extensive customization later. Another downside of using a ``setup.cfg`` file is that it makes it that ``python se[TAB]`` no longer auto-completes to ``python setup.py``! Advanced ``setup.py`` files can become quite complicated (e.g., take a look at [galpy's setup.py file](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy/blob/main/setup.py)), so while it is again instructive to look at other packages' ``setup.py`` files, for beginners this is likely to be highly confusing.\n",

Thus, you should choose a license for your code and put the license file in your code's top-level directory. If code is on GitHub without a license, the GitHub Terms of Service allow people to view and fork the code, but no modifications or re-distribution are permitted (see the [No License](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) GitHub help page).

Typically they allow arbitrary use, modification, and re-distribution provided that the original license is retained, the original author is properly credited, while any liability related to any use of the code is explicitly denied. Examples of permissive licenses are the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and the [BSD 3-clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause), with the MIT License appearing to be the permissive license of choice of recent projects. Permissive licenses allow the broadest use of your code, because they require very little of people using your code. Most of the major Python projects that you know and love use permissive licensing (e.g., ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``astropy``). \n",

    "Copy-left licenses are open-source licenses that in addition to denying liability and requesting credit for the original author also require that any modifications of the code be re-distributed under a similar copy-left license. The main used example of a copy-left license is the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) (there is also an older [version 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0) which is somewhat more permissible).

While it may seem silly to you, explicitly denying liability is an important thing to do when you put code online, to legally protect yourself from mis-use of your code (not that this has ever happened to me, but you never know...). When in doubt, choose a permissive license like the MIT License."
