    "Many scientists still release their code by creating a source distribution (a \"tarball\") and linking to it on their website, but this fails to take advantage of the large amount of support in the Python community (and beyond) to make releasing different versions of your code easy and allowing your code to be installed in standard ways on different platforms with minimal headaches for the users of your package. The primary venue for releasing Python packages is the Python Package Index (``PyPI``) and it is releasing your package on ``PyPI`` that I focus on in this chapter. An additional popular method for releasing your code, especially if it contains compiled code and/or dependencies that are difficult to install, is to make your package installable by Anaconda's ``conda install`` command. The most common way to do this for scientific packages is to use [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), but describing how to get your package onto ``conda-forge`` is beyond the scope of these notes."

    "## Versioning your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you release a first version of your code, you should decide on how you want to label different versions of your code, because once you release the first version, you'll want to start work on the next version! When we first created the [setup.py file](02-Package-Structure.ipynb#The-setup.py-file), we included a version string, but I will now discuss versioning in a little more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code's version could be any unique string that states the version (e.g., \"v1\"), but to make your code's version easy to interpret for a wide variety of users and compatible with standard Python functions to process version numbers, your code should follow the [standard Python versioning scheme](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/). Python version strings should follow the format\n",
    "```\n",
    "[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]\n",
    "```\n",
    "which I will briefly unpack here. We'll ignore the ``[N!]`` part, the [version epoch](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-epochs), which is only used when packages change the way they version and which the author of these notes has never seen in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For released versions, you only have to pay attention to the\n",
    "```\n",
    "N(.N)*\n",
    "```\n",
    "part of the version string. This states that any released version string can be any string of integers separated by periods (e.g., \"0.1.0\"). While arbitrary lengths are in principle allowed, most packages use either two integers separated by a period (e.g., \"1.0\") or three integers, (e.g., \"2.1.3\"). Upon a release, either the last integer is increased by 1 or one of the earlier integers in the sequence is increased and all following integers are set to 0. So, for example, \n",
    "\n",
    "* version \"0.1\" could be increased to either \"0.2\" or to \"1.0\" in the next release, \n",
    "\n",
    "* version \"1.3.2\" could be increased to either of \"2.0.0\", \"1.4.0\", or \"1.3.3\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the version string does *not* contain \"v\", that is, the version is \"1.0.0\", not \"v1.0.0\" (that can be easy to forget!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Python usage of version numbers is *not* to use semantic versioning as advocated by [semver](https://semver.org/), but to use a more loosely defined structure of \"major.minor\" or \"major.minor.patch\" where the \"major\" version is increased only when a package's structure changes dramatically (causing much backwards incompatibility, e.g., Python 2 to Python 3) or when the package matures significantly to deserve a \"1.x.x\" version (having had \"0.x.x\" until then; e.g., [scipy's relatively recent version](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/release/1.0.0-notes.html#why-1-0-now) \"1.0.0\", 16 years after the first release). Therefore, for most Python packages, major version changes are rare (but some packages update the major version more often, e.g., [astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/whatsnew/)). Typical releases will therefore increase the minor version number, e.g., going from version \"1.1\" to \"1.2\". The third integer, called \"patch\" above, indicates small changes such as bug fixes or updates because of dependency changes. Such patch releases would typically be made from a branch of the code created at the latest minor version release to track bug fixes and other small changes, while development of the next minor version continues in the main development branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of the possible version string\n",
    "```\n",
    "[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]\n",
    "```\n",
    "deals with pre- and post-release updates to a package. The ``[{a|b|rc}N]`` part indicates pre-release versions, with ``a`` indicating an alpha release, ``b`` a beta release, and ``rc`` a \"release candidate\". The ``N`` that can optionally follow each of these indicates the N-th version (e.g., \"a2\" would be the second alpha release). Unless you are developing a package with many users and/or that provides essential infrastructure where each release needs to be thoroughly tested, you will typically not make use of these versions (but you could if you want). The ``[.postN]`` is reserved for changes to your code that happen \"post release\". These are changes, not to the source of your code itself, but to the distribution of your code. You can for example create a ``.post1`` release if you forgot to include the License file in your release; if you simply want to add the file, you should create a new release (because a release, once made, is final), but you are not changing any of the code. Finally, the ``[.devN]`` is used to indicate development versions of your code. For example, \"1.1.dev\" is the development version that will lead to release \"1.1\" eventually. Note that there are a bunch of [alternative syntaxes](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#normalization) allowed by the standard (for example, you can use \"alpha\" instead of \"a\"), but for new versions it's best to follow the actual standard discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of all packages using this standard versioning scheme is that this can be easily parsed by automated parsers, to check, for example, which version of a dependency users have installed on their systems. One way to do this is to use ``setuptools``' [pkg_resources](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html), which has a function ``parse_version`` (documented [here](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#parsing-utilities)), that returns an object that represents the version and that can be compared to other such objects. For example, we can check that the installed version of ``scipy`` is at least later than version \"0.19\" by doing\n",
    "```\n",
    "from pkg_resources import parse_version\n",
    "import scipy\n",
    "print(parse_version(scipy.__version__) >= parse_version('0.19'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "``parse_version`` correctly deals with development, pre-release, and post-release versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should include your package's version in the ``setup.py`` file and define the ``__version__`` attribute in your package's top-level ``__init__.py`` file (``exampy/__init__.py`` in the example package); you will likely also want to define it in the documentation's ``source/conf.py``. Because your package's version then appears in multiple places in your code, you need to remember to update it everywhere when you increment the version number. One way to do this is to make it a part of your release checklist (discussed below), you can also make use of automated tools like [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion), which can be configured to automatically update the version string in multiple files whenever you invoke ``bumpversion``.

    "## Preparing for your package's release\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for your package's initial and each subsequent release, you'll want to add or update some files in your repository. It's useful to list files that need to be updated every release as part of a *release checklist* (which you can add as a ``RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`` file in your repository as well) that explicitly lists all of the steps involved in releasing each version of your package, from preparing the release, over uploading your package to PyPI, to setting up the next development version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the files that you will want to add or update for every release are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A ``HISTORY.txt`` or ``HISTORY.md`` (for formatted GitHub content) file that lists major changes and additions to your package since the previous release. For the first release, this file can simply state that this is the first release, but at each subsequent release you should update this file with all of the major changes since the previous release. It's easiest to keep this file up to date by adding to it as you develop each version, rather than writing it at the end. If you find yourself having to write it at the end, go through all Issues and Pull Requests to find major changes, or look through the ``git`` log up to the last release (although if you are making the recommended frequent commits, this will be a long and detailed log). One way to help yourself keep track of major changes is to submit Pull Requests for all of these even if you are making the changes yourself and you could just merge them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If your documentation includes a page summarizing major changes, you'll want to update that one as well.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Update the version number to that of the release you are going to make, typically at least in the ``setup.py`` file and the top level ``__init__.py`` file. You should have been using a version \"x.y.z.dev\" while developing version \"x.y.z\" and in that case this is as simple as removing the \".dev\" part of the version string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To obtain fine-grained control over which files are included in the source distribution, you need to use a ``MANIFEST.in`` file. Many files are included by default, most importantly: all Python files included in your package (through the ``packages`` keyword of the ``setuptools.setup`` command in your ``setup.py`` file), the ``setup.py`` file itself, any files specified in ``setuptools.setup``'s ``package_data`` keyword, scripts included in the setup, C source files for any C extensions specified in ``setuptools.setup``, various ``README`` formats (without extension, or with ``.txt``, ``.rst``, or ``.md`` extension), and the ``MANIFEST.in`` file itself. Test files following ``test/test*.py`` are also included (not ``tests/test*.py``). The ``MANIFEST.in`` file then gives you the option to include extra files or to exclude files from the standard list. To include a file, add a line ``include FILE`` in ``MANIFEST.in`` where ``FILE`` is the path to the file, which can include standard wildcards. To exclude a file, add a line ``exclude FILE`` (e.g., to exclude the tests, add ``exclude test/test*.py``). One file you'll want to include is the LICENSE file. If you have other useful files in your repository, e.g., ``INSTALL.md`` with installation instructions (typically given in the README file) or ``AUTHORS.md`` with contributors to your code, you can also include them in the ``MANIFEST.in`` file. If your package includes a C extension, you'll have to include the header files, because they will not by default be copied to the source distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  As an example, for the ``exampy`` example package, I created the following ``MANIFEST.in``\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  include LICENSE README.md\n",
    "  exclude tests/test*.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  to include the ``LICENSE`` file, to make sure to include the ``README.md`` file (it should be included anyway, but it does not hurt to make sure), and to exclude the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you have added files to your package since the last release, you might have to add some of them to ``MANIFEST.in`` to make sure that they are included in the source distribution. You can get a list of all files added since your last release by running\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  git diff --name-status PREV_RELEASE_HASH | grep ^A\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  where ``PREV_RELEASE_HASH`` is the ``git`` hash corresponding to the previous release.\n",
    "  \n",

    "So far I have only discussed how to release your package's source code, which means that users who install your package have to build the code themselves from the source. While this is relatively straightforward for pure Python packages, if your package is large or if it contains compiled C extensions, the build process can be complex, prone to errors, and long. For example, in [Chapter 6](06-Continuous-Integration.ipynb#Automatically-building-and-testing-your-code:-continuous-integration) we saw that having to build ``numpy`` from source as part of the ``Travis CI`` continuous-integration procedure for the ``exampy`` example package made the run take substantially longer. To make the installation of your code easier, you should create binary distributions called \"wheels\" of your package and upload these to ``PyPI``. When a user then asks to install your package using ``pip`` and a wheel is available for their Python version and platform, the wheel will be installed instead of building the package from source. If your code contains extensions that need to be compiled and you want to support Windows natively, creating pre-built binary releases of your package is essential, because many Windows users will not have a compiler installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The type and number of binary wheels that you can create for your package depends on the code that is included in your package. If your package is a pure Python package (that is, it does not contain compiled extensions, just ``*.py`` files), then you can create a single wheel that can be used on any platform (e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux). If your package contains compiled extensions, you have to create wheels for each platform *and* for each minor Python version that you want to support separately (because the Python C code is specific to each minor version); you therefore have a lot more work then!\n",
    "\n",
    "To build wheels, first you need to install the (wait for it) ``wheel`` package with\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then you can create a binary wheel by running\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py bdist_wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will automatically determine whether to build a platform-agnostic wheel if your package is pure Python or to build a platform/Python-version specific wheel if your package contains compiled code. Build wheels are added to the ``dist/`` directory, which is the reason why the ``twine upload`` commands above specified ``dist/*``; this way both the source distribution and any built wheels are uploaded simultaneously. The example ``exampy`` package is pure Python, so when you run the command a wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "exampy-0.2-py3-none-any.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "is created. The name of the wheel has the format ``PACKAGENAME``-``PACKAGEVERSION``-``PYTHONVERSION``-``PYTHONCVERSION``-``PLATFORM.whl``. Because the package is pure Python, the Python C version that you are using is irrelevant and is therefore set to ``none`` and the platform is arbitrary, thus, ``any``. Because the only major Python version that is currently supported is Python 3, you only need to build a wheel for Python 3; this can be created using any minor Python 3.x version (note that if your package requires features only available in a later 3.x version, the wheel will build and be installable for earlier versions, but the code will likely fail at runtime). When Python 2 was still supported (only a few months ago at the time of writing), you could also create a separate wheel with Python 2 or, if your package directly supported both Python 2 and 3, you could build a universal wheel with ``python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal``, which would work for both major Python versions and would have the name ``exampy-0.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl`` for the example package. However, with Python 2 no longer being supported, there is no need for new packages to create Python 2 wheels (unless they really think users who cannot upgrade want to use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your package includes compiled code, then that code will be compiled as part of the ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` execution and a compiled, built wheel specific to the minor Python version that you use to run the command and the platform will be created. For example, suppose the ``exampy`` package contained a compiled C extension and we ran ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` using Python 3.7 on a Mac, we would create a wheel with the name\n",
    "```\n",
    "exampy-0.2-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "where now the ``PYTHONVERSION`` in ``PACKAGENAME``-``PACKAGEVERSION``-``PYTHONVERSION``-``PYTHONCVERSION``-``PLATFORM.whl`` is ``cp37``, indicating \"CPython 3.7\", since there are other implementations of Python such as [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) (not to be confused with ``PyPI``!). The Python C API version is also CPython 3.7, hence the second ``cp37``, and the platform is the specific Mac version that you ran the command on, in this case Mac OS X 10.9, 64 bit (the ``x86_64`` part). You can create multiple wheels for different Python versions by running ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` with different versions of Python (e.g., using different conda environments or different virtualenv environments). Each of these would be added to the ``dist/`` directory and all would be uploaded to ``PyPI`` using ``twine upload dist/*``.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a wheel on a Linux operating system, the wheel's platform will be something like ``linux_x86_64``, which does not specify the Linux distribution that you are using. For this reason, ``PyPI`` does not accept such Linux wheels, it only accepts ``manylinux1`` wheels built on Linux. These are wheels that are defined in [Python Enhancement Proposal 513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) that are only allowed to link to a small subset of C libraries, such that they can be easily installed on many different Linux distributions. Unless you really care about making your code easy to install on Linux, I would recommend not bothering creating such ``manylinux1`` wheels (Linux users are typically quite sophisticated and should therefore be able to work with a compiler and install dependencies; the only reason to create a binary wheel would be to speed up continuous integration run for packages that have to install your package if building your package from source is slow).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to create multiple compiled wheels for different Python versions and for both Mac OS X and Windows platforms, you can either use a Mac or Windows computer that you have access to, create all different wheels, and upload them all to ``PyPI`` (you can just run \n",
    "```\n",
    "twine upload dist/* --skip-existing\n",
    "```\n",
    "on multiple machines, and files will just be added), or you can use external services to build all of the wheels for you, collect them, and upload them to ``PyPI``. Using external services is good, because it makes sure that the build environment is clean and it means that you don't have to use multiple machines. Because the most important compiled wheel to create is the Windows one, I will describe how to use ``AppVeyor`` to do this, but you could use ``Travis CI`` to do the same for Mac OS X wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way you can create wheels using ``AppVeyor`` is to create them at the end of your [AppVeyor integration runs](06-Continuous-Integration.ipynb#Continuous-integration-for-Windows:-AppVeyor) and add them as an \"Artifact\", which can be downloaded from the ``AppVeyor`` page for your run. Thus, if you haven't already set up continuous integration using ``AppVeyor``, you need to do that first. There are multiple ways to create artifacts on ``AppVeyor``, but one flexible way is to use the command-line command ``Push-AppveyorArtifact``. Typically, you would only create a wheel if your integrations tests pass and to do this, you should add the following section to your ``.appveyor.yml`` file\n",
    "```\n",
    "after_test:\n",
    "  - ps: |\n",
    "      pip install wheel\n",
    "      python setup.py bdist_wheel\n",
    "      Get-ChildItem dist\\*.whl | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_.FullName -FileName $_.Name }\n",
    "```\n",
    "This simply installs the ``wheel`` package, builds the wheel, and then finds the wheel in ``dist\\`` (the Windows path!) and pushes it as an artifact. To find this artifact, navigate to your package's ``AppVeyor`` web page, go to the build and the job that creates the artifact (each job will by default create an artifact), and click on the \"Artifacts\" tab. For the example package, the page that you get to looks like"

    "\n",
    "To create Windows wheels for different Python minor versions, you can use a matrix ``AppVeyor`` build with multiple Python versions as discussed in [Chapter 6](06-Continuous-Integration.ipynb#Continuous-integration-for-Windows:-AppVeyor). If you run multiple jobs for the same Python version (e.g., like in the example in Chapter 6, where I run jobs with three different ``numpy`` versions for each Python version), you may only want to create artifacts for one of the jobs for each Python version (not that you couldn't create them for each job, since they are specific to a job, but it would be somewhat wasteful). To do this, you could add an environment variable ``BUILD_ARTIFACT`` that is either ``\"true\"`` or ``\"false\"``, depending on whether you want the job to create the artifact, and then use\n",

    "To add these ``AppVeyor`` built artifacts to your release, you can just download the one(s) created for the ``AppVeyor`` run corresponding to the ``git tag`` of your release into your local ``dist/`` folder and then upload them from your machine using ``twine upload`` when you upload the source distribution as well. You can set things up such that wheels are automatically uploaded to ``PyPI`` from ``AppVeyor`` itself, but you probably want to finely control exactly what gets uploaded to your official release on ``PyPI``, which is difficult when the upload happens automatically. Unless you release so often that you need the automation, it's easiest to just download the wheels and upload them to ``PyPI`` yourself."
