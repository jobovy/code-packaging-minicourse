    "All code should be under version control to keep track of changes over time and when it comes to version control ``git`` is the dominant system. A 2018 Stack Overflow survey of developers' version control use found that [90% of developers use git](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-_-version-control), with the second most popular version control being the older [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), likely mostly to use legacy code that still lives in Subversion repositories. ``git`` is most widely supported by code hosting services, with [GitHub](https://github.com/) only hosting ``git`` repositories and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) [dropping support](https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket) for the main ``git`` alternative ``mercurial`` in 2020.

    "## Version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system for tracking and making changes to code as the code develops. Version control stores code in a \"repository\" and when using version control, any changes to the code are logged through a code \"commit\" that lists the files changed and provides a brief description of the changes; version control software then generates a \"diff\" with respect to the previous version that gets stored, such that the full history of changes is available for use in the future. Opinions differ on how many changes to include in a single commit (which can consist of changes to multiple files at once), but typically it is best to keep commits as \"atomic\" as possible, that is, create a commit at the smallest change that is reasonable to call a change or improvement to the code. Commits are often as small as changing a single line, perhaps improving the documentation or fixing a small bug. When making changes to existing code, it is always best to keep commits at the level of small changes, so any issues with the changes can later easily be pinned down to a specific change; change commits should typically consist of a few lines to a few dozen lines of edited code at most. When first implementing a new feature, it may make sense to wait to commit until a draft version of the feature is working and one can thus end up with a larger commit, but even then it is best to first implement a skeleton of the new feature and then edit it with small changes until the feature is fully implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early version control systems stored the history of changes in a central location while each developer only had a copy of the current version of the code; thus, every code commit and every query of the code's history required interaction with the central location (often remote, requiring an internet connection). Because this meant that one could not commit while offline and even when online was an impediment to quick progress due to the sometimes slow response time of the central location, this led to often bloated commits. One of the great improvements in ``git`` is that each copy of the code's repository contains the full history, leading to a decentralized system where there is no need for a central location. Different copies of a ``git`` repositories are called \"clones\" and with ``git``, clones can communicate among themselves without needing to go through a central place. Of course, the current reality is that most ``git`` repositories have \"main\" copies that are stored in online services like GitHub or Bitbucket, with most of the communication between different clones happening through the main hosted copy of the code. Nevertheless, the fact that each clone contains the entire history means that you can easily commit code and investigate the history without requiring interaction with a centralized repository, and this is therefore much faster and robust against network interruptions.\n",

    "## Basic ``git`` use\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic cycle of ``git`` use is a cycle of ``git pull``, ``git commit``, ``git push``. These commands, respectively, pull in the latest changes from the remote main version of the code repository (e.g., hosted on GitHub), commit new changes made to the code, and push the changes in this commit(s) back to the remote main version. If you add ``git diff`` for looking at the not-yet-committed current set of changes, ``git status`` for interrogating the status of the repository and ``git log`` for looking at the history of the code, and you have well over 95% of my typical usage of ``git``.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with ``git``, you can initialize any directory to be a ``git`` repository using\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "which initializes an *empty* ``git`` repository. That is, even if the directory already has files in them, these are *not* automatically added to the ``git`` repository, instead, you need to add them yourself. To follow along with this tutorial, you can create, for example, a directory ``exampy-GITHUBUSERNAME`` where you can build your own version of the ``exampy`` package that I discussed in the [previous chapter](02-Package-Structure.ipynb). Keep in mind that while we use ``git init`` here to get started with ``git``, typically the way you start a new ``git`` repository is *not* by running this command-line command, but instead by creating a new repository on GitHub and setting it up online in such a way that you can directly clone a local copy and start pulling, committing, and pushing changes (see [below](#Using-GitHub-to-build-a-community-for-your-code)). I don't think I have run ``git init`` once in the last eight years.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, you should make a commit as soon as enough changes to the code have accrued to make up a reasonable change to the code (again, this could be as simple as fixing a typo in the code, a single character). Simply running\n",

    "```\n",
    "git commit -m \"A message describing the atomic change made\"\n",

    "git commit -m \"A message describing the atomic change made\" file1.py file2.py\n",
    "```\n",

This way, you don't end up accidentally committing changes made to other files that are unrelated to the current commit (we will see [below](#Some-useful-advanced-git-features) how you can even split up changes in a single files into different commits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start committing changes to files, you need to tell ``git`` about the existence of the file in the first place (typically soon after you create the file, in preparation for your first commit of the file). This is done using ``git add`` which you call with\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add file1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "and you can also list multiple files. Even though you specify a directory and you can use wildcards, it is again good practice to always explicitly list all files that you are adding, rather than an entire folder or more, because that way you will invariably end up adding files that you did not want to add and removing them again can be difficult.\n",

When you have cloned the code from GitHub and are working in the main branch, a simple\n",

    "git pull\n",

    "## Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature of most version control systems and one that is especially easy to use with ``git`` is the ability to *branch* off the main development branch of your code to focus on developing a single feature, fix a single bug, etc. After you are satisfied with the changes on the branch, these changes are *merged* back into the main development commit history. A crucial part of the implementation of the ``git`` software is fast and intelligent algorithms to perform such merges automatically, even when the difference between the feature branch and the main branch are substantial. When ``git`` is unable to automatically merge branches, the repository goes into a suspended state until the user manually resolves any merges that cannot be automatically done.\n",

    "Branches are an incredibly useful feature of ``git``, especially when combined with *forks* discussed [below](#Using-GitHub-to-build-a-community-for-your-code), and you should make liberal use of them. Branches allow you to split off things like implementing new features, while still keeping the ability to fix bugs in the main branch without that fix having to wait for the new feature to be ready to go \"live\". Branches also allow you to develop new features in the incremental way that you should implement all of your code (with many commits), without necessarily having to worry at first that the new feature is entirely compatible with the existing code or that it passes all existing tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main branch is called ``main``. It is good practice to keep this branch as clean as possible, that is, avoid having it be in a state where it contains partially implemented features or bug fixes.

This will leave the repository in a \"detached HEAD\" state, which doesn't sound good and which isn't indeed all that good (if you want to actually start making changes, you will have to create a new branch starting from this commit), but it allows you to switch back to an earlier state of the repository and see what it looked like or run tests etc. for the earlier state. That's often useful when you are trying to figure out where in the commit history *something went wrong*.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is [GitHub](https://github.com/)? GitHub is an online service to host software packages using the ``git`` version control system and that has many of the additional bells and whistles to help with a package's development, maintenance, and community interaction. While there is no direct association between ``git`` and GitHub (there are other services to host ``git`` repositories, like BitBucket), at this point ``git`` and GitHub are heavily associated with one another and it seems to me that the total dominance that ``git`` has attained over other similar version-control systems has much to do with the exquisite support for hosting ``git`` repositories that GitHub has provided now for many years. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, GitHub provides the central location where the main copy of your repository is stored, the location from which you ``git pull`` and to which you ``git push`` changes to the code. As such, it provides a crucial back-up service for your code and a central hub that you can use to keep different copies of your code up-to-date with one another. But GitHub provides many more features than that. For aiding in the development and maintenance of your code, GitHub provides a full online viewer of your code, arranged as a file system that is a central part of your code's GitHub website, which allows you to see the latest version of your code as well as the code at any commit in its history. It can also display changes made in each commit in an easy-to-understand format and show you differences between the code at different points in the code's history. But GitHub's most important feature is that it provides your code's public face where users of your code will go to learn about the code, to find your code's documentation, to interact with the developer(s), to commit patches to the code, etc. For many modern code packages, their GitHub page is *the* public website of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can [import](https://github.com/new/import) an existing code repository hosted elsewhere online, typically you start by **creating a** [**new**](https://github.com/new) **repository** (log into your GitHub account to access this page). This brings up a page that asks basic information about the code repository that you want to create. First you specify the repository's name and this should typically be the name of your software package; GitHub does not require names across GitHub to be unique (only within your own account), but as we have discussed before, [using a globally unique name is important](02-Package-Structure.ipynb#Naming-your-package). Then you can specify a brief description (which can be easily edited later, but it is good practice to always start with a cogent description) and whether to make the repository public (viewable by all internet users) or private (accessible only to yourself and any explicitly added collaborators). If your intention is for a wide range of users to use your code, you'll want to make it public! But even if this is your plan, you may want to start off creating a simple version of your repository in private if you so desire (I don't judge, as long as you make it public soon 😀). Note that if you are an academic educator or researcher,  GitHub has a [program](https://education.github.com/benefits) that gives you a free \"Pro\" account, which comes with unlimited private repositories. When you make a repository private, you can always change it to public later in the repository's Settings. You can then choose to \"Initialize this repository with a README\", which is a good thing to do, because it will create a skeleton GitHub repository that contains a README file in Markdown format (therefore, ``README.md``) that contains the name and description (and that's all your repository will contain at this point!). Starting out with a ``README.md`` means that you can then clone the repository to your local machine, and start adding and committing changes without having to locally ``git init`` an empty repository. You also have the option to add a ``.gitignore`` file (this is a file that contains rules for files that git should largely ignore, e.g, not list as unknown files to ``git`` when you run ``git status``; this contains entries like ``*.pyc`` to ignored compiled bytecode Python files; for a Python project, choose the Python version of the ``.gitignore`` file).

    "git remote add origin https://github.com/GITHUBUSERNAME/REPOSITORYNAME.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "to tell your local repository about the newly created GitHub repository and then do\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push -u origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "to push your local initialization to GitHub. You can run this command after as many commits as you want, that is, you can even push ``git`` repositories with thousands of commits to a newly-created GitHub repository and the GitHub repository will then contain the entire previous history of the code in the same way as if you had developed it while using GitHub (in that sense, GitHub is simply a viewer of your repository's commit history).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have initialized your GitHub repository with a ``README.md`` file, you typically will create a local copy by running (e.g., for the repository that contains these notes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/jobovy/code-packaging-minicourse.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "The URL here is standard ``https://github.com/GITHUBUSERNAME/REPOSITORYNAME.git``, but the simplest way to obtain it is to go your repository's GitHub page and click the big green \"Clone or download\" button near the top, which will allow you to copy the URL to your clipboard. As the name implies, ``git clone`` creates an exact, full copy of the GitHub repository on your local machine. When you obtain your local copy in this way, the local copy is automatically aware of the central GitHub location of your code, such that commands like ``git pull`` and ``git push`` work without requiring any immediate further setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a branch in your local copy of the repository, you need to tell your local copy how to link up this branch with a branch in the GitHub version of your code. Simply trying to run ``git pull`` in a newly created branch tells you what you have to do here: You can either always (tediously) specify the remote branch as\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull origin BRANCHNAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "(similar for ``git push``) where \"origin\" is a shorthand for the GitHub repository (in general, the central location of your code's repository) or you can save this information using\n",
    "```\n",
    "git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/BRANCHNAME BRANCHNAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "such that you can again simply do ``git pull`` and ``git push`` and changes will be pulled and pushed to the correct branch on GitHub. Note that if you have not yet pushed a newly created branch to GitHub, the ``git pull origin BRANCHNAME`` command will fail to find the remote branch; in this case, first push the branch with ``git push origin BRANCHNAME``.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of GitHub most crucial features is that it allows other users to easily create their own copy of your code and hosting that on GitHub as well by creating a \"fork\" of your code. That is, **a fork is a copy of your code that is hosted under another user's account and that is identical to your** ``git`` **repository** (including all commits) up to the point at which the fork was made. This allows other users to make changes to your code using ``git`` without needing write access to your version of the code, they can push changes to their own version of the code and make these available to other users via GitHub. People who fork your code cannot directly write to your GitHub repository and neither can you write to their fork of your repository (but GitHub prominently links back to the original version). The purpose of most forks is for other users to make changes to the code that will quickly or eventually be merged back into the main GitHub repository, but some codes have forks that are long-lasting and never re-unite with the original repository. To create a fork, navigate to a repository's GitHub page and click the Fork button at the top right. If during work in a fork you want to merge in subsequent changes made in the original repository, you will need to tell the clone of your fork about the original repository. The original repository is normally called the \"upstream\" and you add it as a remote repository as, e.g.,\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/jobovy/code-packaging-minicourse.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "if you have forked the repository containing these notes and want to merge in changes made in the original repository. Then you can pull in changes from an \"upstream\" branch with, e.g.,\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull upstream main\n",
    "```\n",
    "to pull in changes from the upstream ``main`` branch. Note that the \"upstream\" in this command is simply the shorthand for the URL that you added with the ``git remote add`` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main mechanism for merging changes made in a fork of a repository back into the main repository is through a \"pull request\"**, essentially a request to ``git pull`` the changes from the fork into the main repository (although what's actually done is a ``git merge``). A fork is essentially like a set of branches, where all of the original repository's branches are present as duplicates of the original's and users can add additional branches. Merging changes made in a fork is essentially the same as merging changes from a branch as we discussed [above](#Branches), with the only difference being that the fork is hosted remotely. Every GitHub repository has a tab called \"Pull requests\", which lists the currently-open and previously-closed pull requests. To initiate a pull request, either go the main repository's ``Pull requests`` tab and click \"New pull request\" or go to your fork's page, which has a ``Pull request`` button that would initiate the pull request. When you open a pull request, you should give a brief rationale behind the change that is being asked to be merged in. It is good practice not to make changes to a fork's ``main`` branch, but to instead create a new branch to implement changes and then initiate a pull request from this branch to the original ``main`` branch. For one thing, this will allow the original repository's owner to check out your fork's branch more easily if this becomes necessary in the review or merging process. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a pull request, the original code repository's owners will likely ask you additional questions about the changes, to edit the changes to abide by the main repository's coding style, to make sure that documentation/tests are updated (e.g., the log of changes), etc. and GitHub allows this conversation to happen on the page associated with the pull request. Keep in mind that your pull request may be rejected by the code's owners: maybe it is implementing a new feature that they do not wish to support and maintain in the future (any new feature will entail a maintenance burden that will typically fall on the code's owners rather than the person implementing it in a fork), or maybe they want more explanation/documentation/tests and you are not willing to provide this. Large pull requests may be difficult to review, so good pull requests are typically small (you may be able to split up a big change into smaller, atomic pull requests if each one can stand on its own). If you are concerned about doing a lot of work that might get rejected, contact the authors through the communication channel(s) that they prefer *before you start the work*, so you can find out whether they would be amenable to a pull request or not (you may want to do this by opening an Issue [see below] if there is no other obvious way to contact the code owners/maintainers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging pull requests proceeds in the same way as merging between branches in a ``git`` repository, with the main difference being that if the merge can be done automatically, the merge can be done entirely through the GitHub site of your code, with no need to check out the fork's code on your own machine. If there is a merge conflict, you have to check out the fork's code and manually merge them (although you will likely want to ask the fork's author to do this on their side, unless it requires deeper knowledge of the code than the fork's author can reasonably be expected to have). GitHub has extensive support for helping in the review of pull requests, allowing you to make comments on all of the changes and request additional changes, asking for reviews from particular contributors before approving the changes to be merged, and running any automated tests that you have and reporting their results. If you are expecting to have pull requests be a common way for your code to evolve, it is essential to have an [automated test suite](05-Tests.ipynb) run with [continuous integration](06-Continuous-Integration.ipynb) that covers most of the lines in your code, to protect against unforeseen issues when changes are merged into the main code's repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull requests are the most important social aspect of how your code can grow when it's hosted on GitHub, but GitHub has many more features for the community of your users. **A helpful README file is a great way to introduce your code to your users** and READMEs can have a variety of formats that allow nice-looking GitHub sites to be created (don't have one of those drab pure ``README`` GitHub sites, use a Markdown ``README.md`` or a reStructuredText ``README.rst`` to create an attractive first impression for your code). Like the \"Pull requests\" tab, there is also an **\"Issues\" tab that provides a venue for users of your code to report issues with its installation or use**. Anybody with a GitHub account can open an Issue, which then goes into a list of open issues to be resolved. Any given issue typically consists of a conversation between the user reporting the issue and the code's maintainer(s) to figure out the root of the issue and commits that resolve the issue. Each issue has a unique number that you can reference in code commits as ``#NUMBER`` and GitHub will automatically link this commit to the issue online (you can even close issues through commits, by writing phrases like \"fixes #NUMBER\" in the commit! But make sure that the commit actually fixes the issue, because otherwise you will have to re-open it). When you are reporting an issue, it is important to write up a useful description of the issue: succinctly explain what the issue is, give the version of the code that you are using and the version of any other relevant component (e.g., the Python version, your operating system, etc.), and try to create a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of the issue which allows the maintainer to quickly reproduce the issue themself and which can form the basis of a test added to the code's test suite checking that the issue is and remains resolved. Report any errors in full, using a service like [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) to paste large logs (to not clog up the Issues page). When you open an issue, respond promptly to any follow-up questions (don't open an issue just before going on vacation!) and make sure to close the issue once it has been resolved.\n",
