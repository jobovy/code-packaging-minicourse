    "Thoroughly testing your code is crucial for allowing others (and yourself!) to use it confidently, for maintaining your code long-term, and for developing new features. Testing your code needs to be done *continuously*, that is, it is not long-term useful to perform a test of the implementation of a new feature or of its integration with the rest of your package if you do not save the test and re-run it every time the code changes; unfortunately, only testing code at its first implementation still remains the main mode in which scientific software is tested. Instead you need to write a comprehensive **test suite** that checks that your code keeps working the way you intend it to work as your package grows and evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a comprehensive test suite is essential for being as confident as you can be that your code behaves correctly (of course, no test suite is 100% water tight). But having a comprehensive test suite also helps you maintain and develop your package. A test suite makes maintenance easier, because you can catch new problems early (e.g., an issue stemming from a change in a dependency), when they are typically easier to solve. It is also easy to check that your package works with a new minor (or major, but that will likely be a while) version of Python itself. It also helps you in developing your code, especially in allowing large-scale changes to the underlying framework of your package without changing the package's user interface (or without changing it much). For example, if you want to completely re-vamp the way a complex sub-module of your code with many functions and classes is implemented, this is difficult to do without a comprehensive test suite, because it would be difficult to be sure that no user-facing functionality changed. But with a good test suite, you can be confident that your underlying changes do not break code that people have that uses your package or the way they interact with your code. Having a comprehensive test suite is also absolutely essential if you will be accepting pull requests from outside users (which you should!): without a test suite, it would be very difficult to know that changes proposed in a pull request (especially if there are many) do not break some part of your code (you would be surprised at how easily even a small change in one part of your package can cause problems in unexpected places).\n",

    "Tests of a Python package are regular Python statements, functions, etc., just like any other Python code. They become tests of your software package simply by virtue of *context*: tests are regular Python files that live in a designated spot for tests of your package and that consist of a set of statements checking that your code works as intended. At some level, any use of your package by yourself and other users is a test of your code, because users will (or should) be sanity-checking your code's results and report issues if the results are incorrect or unexpected. But your package should contain a dedicated set of tests, which we refer to as a *test suite*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first decision you have to make is where to put your tests. Tests should be part of the same ``git`` repository that contains the package itself and then there are essentially two options: (i) you can put the tests *outside of the package itself*, by putting them in a sub-directory of the top-level directory of your package's ``git`` repository, or (ii) you can incorporate the tests *into the package itself*, that is, include them as a sub-directory within your Python package's directory (or in a set of sub-directories, e.g., to separate tests by submodule). The latter option allows you to include the tests in distributions of your code, which may be useful to allow people who have installed your code to run the tests themselves and verify that they pass on their system. However, I believe it is better to choose option (i) and keep the tests outside of the package itself. This is for a few reasons: (a) packages should be as light-weight as possible and a comprehensive test suite will be large (e.g., for ``galpy``, the test suite currently contains about 30k lines, while the package itself has about 40k, excluding comments and docstrings), (b) your package should be as well documented and tested as possible, but you will likely not document the tests much and almost certainly not write a test suite for the tests (and so on!), (c) your tests may have difficult-to-install dependencies that you do not want users of your code to have to install, and (d) the main issues that users will run into are installation issues; when they can install and load your code, it's highly unlikely that a test of the code's functionality would fail, so there really isn't too much point in normal users of your code running the test suite themselves if you run it often yourself. Thus, you should include tests in a ``tests/`` sub-directory of your top-level directory, which therefore now looks like (for the ``exampy`` example package from [chapter 2](02-Package-Structure.ipynb#Package-layout)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "TOP-LEVEL_DIRECTORY/\n",
    "    docs/\n",
    "    exampy/\n",
    "    tests/\n",
    "    README.md\n",
    "    setup.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``tests/`` directory then contains a set of Python ``.py`` files that contain tests of your code. For a large software package, one option would be to mirror your package's structure of sub-modules and arrange tests in a similar directory tree under ``tests/``, but typically it's easy enough to simply include a bunch of ``*.py`` files in the ``tests/`` directory itself that test all of your package's functionality in all of its submodules. To seamlessly integrate with the ``pytest`` test framework, your tests should be arranged as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tests should be in files with filenames that start with ``test_`` and end in ``.py``, so for example, ``test_basic_math.py`` will contain tests of the basic math included in ``exampy``'s top-level module (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions that contain tests to be run within the test files should start with ``test``; if you use classes to arrange tests, these need to start with ``Test``. Your test files can include other functions or classes, for example as helper functions/classes for your tests, but these will not be executed as tests by ``pytest`` below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will focus on the case of using functions to write tests, rather than classes. Using classes for tests is useful when your tests require common, expensive initialization procedures, which can easily be done with a ``TestX`` test class, but is difficult when using functions. When this is not necessary, it is easier to simply use functions that contain all of the setup for your test, such that they can stand alone and can be run independently from each other. This is useful when diagnosing problems with your tests or code, so you don't always have to run the entire (or a large part of the) test suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a matter of taste how you arrange tests of different parts of your package into a set of test files. One option is to have a single file per package file that contains the tests of that package file's functionality, but that leaves it unclear where to put tests of the integration of different parts of your package. Another option is to use one file (or a few files, if a logical division can be made) for each submodule and then include tests of the interplay between different submodules in the most relevant submodule's test file(s). However you choose to arrange your tests, use a logical structure that makes it easy to find where tests are located for your future self and for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on to describe how to write Python tests, it is useful to consider what are *good* properties of tests of a scientific software package and how to construct a good test suite:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Many of your tests should be as minimal, short, and atomic as possible*: you should strive to make sure that each function in your package does what you intend it to do and that it does this correctly; this is called [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). If your package is well written, it should consist mostly of relatively small units (functions, classes, etc.) that work together to do more complex things. Unit testing makes sure that the smallest units of code in your package work as intended, because having all of the parts of a complex code work is a prerequisite to having the entire complex code working correctly. Testing these small units of your package should be possible with relatively brief tests: they should require as little setup as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Your test suite should include integration tests*: Besides making sure that the atomic parts of your code work correctly, you should test that they work together to create more complex workflows that work as expected. Even if all of the individual parts of your code work to your satisfaction, it can still easily be the case that their combination does not work as you intended (this can be as simple as their outputs and inputs not being compatible, or more complicated when, e.g., approximations that seem correct for parts of your code are not good enough for their combination with other parts of your code). These integration tests will typically be more complex pieces of Python code that more directly resemble actual use of your code, but that's okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Your tests should run in as little time as possible*: Having to wait for a long test-suite to run before knowing whether or not your code contains bugs or other errors will strongly impede your progress (I should know, ``galpy``'s test suite currently runs for close to an hour, even when spreading the tests over six machines!). Thus, you want your tests to run *fast*. Because a test suite for any decent-sized package will contain many individual test functions, each of the individual test functions should run very fast in order for the entire test suite to run quickly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Of course, for complex scientific software, it is inevitable that some tests will require a longer time to run (long in the context of tests starts at something like one second, and you should definitely avoid any test that requires more than a minute to run). You might want to check that your code works to a certain high level of precision and that level of precision requires a long computation. In such cases, it is useful to also include a shorter version of the same test if this is possible (for example, one that requires less time to get a lower precision result) that can be run before the longer version of the test, such that not-too-subtle bugs can be found using the shorter test without having to wait for the longer test to finish. Of course, this only makes sense of the shorter test is significantly shorter, such that it does not increase the total test runtime much.\n",
    " \n",
    "* *You should test outputs of your code as well as the important errors and warnings that it raises*: You want to focus your efforts on making sure that the values your code returns are correct, but if your code raises errors in certain cases or warnings, it is important to test whether these are raised appropriately as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You should test setting non-default values for your functions' keyword parameters*: For all functions with optional parameters, you should test that changing the value of any optional parameters is properly handled by the code (e.g., to make sure you haven't accidentally hard-coded the value of an optional parameter somewhere). If you have more than one optional parameter, it quickly becomes difficult to test all possible combinations of setting or not setting keywords, but there is little harm in combining these and simply using a test that changes the value of *all* keywords from their defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You want to have at least one test for each function, but it's typically best to test many different invocations*: Even for simple functions, try multiple values of the input arguments and keywords to more extensively test the function. If your function has conditional statements, this is likely necessary to obtain a high coverage, as we will discuss more below (because a single invocation only tests a single path through your code's conditional statements, thus not testing the other paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Add a test for each reported issue whose fix requires a code change*: When users report an issue with the code that requires you to change the code, add a test that checks that the issue was fixed. This will prevent the issue from arising again in the future, e.g., when you accidentally undo the fix later. Often the best way to start editing your code in response to a reported issue is to *first* write a test that fails because of the issue and then make the fix in the code; once the test passes you are ready to close the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *You should document your test suite*: Many tests of a scientific software package will be non-trivial (e.g., checking the code against the result of an analytical calculation). To make sure you remember what you were thinking when you wrote specific test, extensively document your reasoning with code comments. Users will not (typically) be importing and using your test suite, so there is no need for true docstrings, but keeping a basic level of documentation of all functions in your test suite will make it easier for you and other developers to understand, use, and extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from these general desirable properties of a good test suite, the structure of good tests for a scientific software package will depend strongly on the package itself. While including very simple test cases of general functions is useful for catching major issues (e.g., testing the ``exampy.integrate.riemann`` function with a constant function), be careful in only depending on the simplest possible tests, because it is likely that these would not catch more subtle issues with your code because they are *too* simple (i.e., even a slightly wrong version of your code might get them right enough). In my own field of astrophysics, we often have analytical solutions for certain inputs of computations that our code can perform in general and it is useful to test that such analytical solutions are correctly reproduced (and it is good to test against non-trivial analytical solutions if they exist). If a computational problem has no known analytical solution, we often still know of certain properties that the solution should have or we have constraints on the solution and we can test that these properties and constraints are satisfied (e.g., when solving the Newtonian equation of motion for a conservative, time-independent force, we know that the energy associated with the solution is conserved). Another way to test your code may be to compare it to an alternative solution, for example, one that only applies in certain cases (but isn't analytic) and/or one that is part of a different package that should be consistent. As with documentation before, it is difficult to write *too many tests* and as long as they run in a reasonable amount of time, erring on the side of testing your code too much is better than not testing it enough!"

For example, the simplest function in ``exampy`` is ``exampy.square`` and we check that this function returns the square by checking a few known solutions. This is done in the following function that we add to ``tests/test_basic_math.py``\n",

    "As you can see, I add a total of three ``assert`` statements that check the behavior of the square function against the known square of the numbers one, two, and three (which I worked out analytically for you ...). Python ``assert`` statements have a very simple behavior: in the case of ``assert True, msg``, nothing happens and the statement following this is executed; in case of ``assert False, msg``, an ``AssertionError`` is raised and the ``msg`` string is printed, and ``msg`` should therefore contain a useful message explaining what went wrong. Therefore, I have written the test of the square function as an ``assert`` that the result from the square function agrees with the known value to a known absolute tolerance (using the ``math.fabs`` function). I have chosen to include the two ``import`` statements to make this test a fully self-contained code example, but when this test file grows, you may want to move these to the top level of the file, such that they do not need to be repeated in each test (however, repeating them makes all of the tests self-contained code snippets, which may be useful when developing and testing the tests). Note that you can also use the [numpy.allclose](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.allclose.html) function to test whether two numbers or arrays agree to some relative and absolute tolerance (e.g., as ``numpy.allclose(exampy.square(2.),4.) ``), but I will not discuss that here.\n",

    "Now that we are well underway to writing a good test suite, an important question crops up: How comprehensive is our test suite? That is, to what extend does the test suite actually test all of the code included in the package and to what degree does it cover different ways different parts of the package work together? Answering these questions is the domain of **test coverage** and in this section I give a brief introduction to the important concepts to consider when worrying about your code's test coverage and how to use software tools to check your tests' code coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different coverage criteria depending on how thoroughly you want to define \"coverage\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Function coverage* (including *class coverage* and *method coverage*): This type of coverage checks whether every function (or class, or method) of your package is called by the test suite (and thus, if your test suite passes all tests, that there is a successful evaluation of each function/class/method of your package). This is the first type of coverage you should aim to have when starting to build a test suite. But if your functions contain conditional parts, then 100% function coverage can still leave many parts of your code untested.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Statement coverage*: Going beyond function coverage, this type of coverage demands that each statement in your code is executed. Thus, 100% statement coverage means that every single statement in your software package is executed at least once by your test suite. As I will discuss further below, this is relatively easy to measure, realistic to attain, and achieving 100% statement coverage is what your test suite should aim for. However, statement coverage may still leave parts of your code untested, especially if your code is written in a way that gets around statement coverage (see example below). To more fully characterize test coverage, there are two more advanced coverage types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Branch coverage*: This type of coverage checks that every branch in your code (e.g., the three possible evaluations of an ``if: ... elif: ... else: ...`` block) gets executed by your tests. Thus, for every conditional part of your code, your tests should go through each possibility. More generally, branch coverage can mean *testing every possible distinct path through your code's conditional statements*. If your code contains more than a few conditional statements, the number of possible paths grows exponentially and in practice it becomes impossible to test each possible path, but it is useful to keep in mind that testing different paths through your code is a good idea. Measuring branch coverage is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Condition coverage*: If your code contains conditional statements with complex boolean expressions (e.g., ``if (x > 0 and y < -1):``), then this type of coverage checks whether *each boolean sub-expression* evaluates to both ``True`` and ``False`` in your test suite. That is, this goes beyond statement coverage, which in this example could be achieved by the total boolean expression evaluating to ``True`` (and ``False`` if there is an ``else:`` statement as well), without going through all possible combinations of boolean sub-expressions. Condition coverage is also difficult to measure, but is a good standard to aim for when writing tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "While branch coverage implies statement coverage, and statement coverage implies function coverage, statement coverage does not imply branch coverage, because of edge cases such as\n",
    "```\n",
    "if math.fabs(x) < 1e-10: x= 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "which as a line (which is the unit most tools for measuring coverage use) registers as executed no matter whether the condition ``math.fabs(x) < 1e-10`` is ``True`` or ``False``. To avoid getting into this situation, always start on a new line after an ``if``, ``elif``, ``else``, ``for``, ``while`` etc. statement (that is, any statement ending in a colon ``:``). Neither of condition coverage and branch coverage also necessarily implies the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only useful type of coverage in the end is that which can be easily measured while running your test suite and this is *statement coverage*. While you should aim for as comprehensive as possible condition and branch coverage, because these are difficult to measure they are hard to quantitatively achieve.\n",

The standard method for doing this is to add a comment ``# pragma: no cover `` at the end of the statement. For a regular statement, this excludes the current line from the coverage report, but if you add it at the end of a function definition, a conditional statement (e.g., ``if x < 0: # pragma: no cover ``), a for loop, or any statement ending in a colon, then the entire following code block will be excluded.

    "If your package contains non-Python code, for example, compiled C code to speed up computations, and you want to check the test coverage of this code as well, you need to use additional tools. This is too advanced of a topic to cover in detail here, but to get you on your way here is an overview of the process for C code: (i) to collect coverage information, you need to compile your C code without optimization (``-O0``) and with the ``gcov`` coverage option ``-coverage`` (in compilation and linking). This will allow the ``gcov`` coverage tool to collect coverage information for any execution of your code (similar to what ``coverage run`` does above); (ii) use [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) to generate a coverage report, e.g., with commands like ``lcov --capture --base-directory . --directory build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/exampy/ --no-external --output-file coverage.info`` which collects the coverage information into the ``coverage.info`` file, (iii) generate a HTML page with the coverage reports with, e.g., ``genhtml coverage.info --output-directory out``. The online services that I discuss in the next chapter also allow you to combine Python and C coverage reports into a single HTML overview."
